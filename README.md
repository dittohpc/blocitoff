The self-destructing to-do lists application

To-do lists are notorious for collecting junk: to-do items that you want to remember, but are not very important and thus get consistently put off. To address the problem of to-do list clutter, therefore, I am creating Blocitoff.

Blocitoff will aim to keep to-do lists manageable by automatically deleting to-do items that have not been completed after seven days. The hypothesis is that if the to-do item is not important enough to be completed in seven days, it doesn't belong on your to-do list.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.


Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...


Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
